# Arduino Ambilight Clone
In this repository you will find all the code you need in order to build your own Ambilight system.

There is a Step-by-step article that I am writing in order to provide guidance to those who want build their own Ambilight :)

Currently, the article is at ***80%***

I will publish the Hackster.io link once it is done in this README file üëç
